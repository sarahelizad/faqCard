### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This project expanded my knowledge of CSS Flexbox and Grid. I have more experience with Bootstrap Grids but I decided to not use Bootstrap for this project and instead "flex" my pure CSS muscles. It took me a few hours to craft the accordion section to my liking. I also experimented with input type radio versus input type checkbox and chose the checkbox input ultimately. At one point, the accordion was styled beautifully but the FAQ items wouldn't open up to reveal the content. I finally realized it was because I gave the "for" attribute a different name than the id attribute in my html file.

What I loved about this project:
-Layering SVG images
-Implementing the webpage layout, particularly the background gradient
-The overall webpage aesthetic


### Continued development
I want to continue working on layering images and implementing a mobile-first approach.
